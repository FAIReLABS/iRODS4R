We leveraged this functionality for R in that you can move around and store any R object you like.\nLet’s have a look this by launching an iRODS demo server, like so:\nNote that one needs Bash and Docker (with docker-compose) to use this mock-up\n\nlibrary(rirods)\nuse_irods_demo(\"martin\", \"secret\")\n\n\nDo the following to connect with the iRODS demo server: \ncreate_irods(\"http://localhost/irods-rest/0.9.3\", \"tempZone/home\") \niauth(\"martin\", \"secret\")\n\n\n\ncreate_irods(\"http://localhost/irods-rest/0.9.3\", \"/tempZone/home\")\n\n\niauth(\"martin\", \"secret\")\n\nImagine you just created an amazing R workflow:\n\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nvolcano_long <- as_tibble(volcano) |>\n  rownames_to_column(\"X\") |> \n  mutate(X = as.integer(X)) |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    !X,     \n    cols_vary = \"slowest\",\n    names_to = c(\".value\", \"Y\"),\n    names_pattern = \"(V)(\\\\d+)\",\n    names_transform = list(Y = as.integer)\n  ) \n\nWarning: The `x` argument of `as_tibble.matrix()` must have unique column names if\n`.name_repair` is omitted as of tibble 2.0.0.\nℹ Using compatibility `.name_repair`.\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np <- ggplot(volcano_long, aes(X, Y, fill= V)) + \n    geom_tile() +\n    labs(title = \"Volcano\") +\n    theme_void() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nisaveRDS(p, \"p.rds\", count = 3e3)\n\n\nireadRDS(\"p.rds\", count = 8e6)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s spin back and give a short introduction to iRODS.\n\nstop_irods_demo()"
